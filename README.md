# Weather-App
A Django weather app retrieves real-time weather data for a specified location using a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) and displays it on a user-friendly webpage. The app involves setting up views and forms to accept user input, calling the API to fetch weather data, and designing templates to display information like temperature.
